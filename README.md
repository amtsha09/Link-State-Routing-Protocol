# Link-State-Routing-Protocol

    Link State Routing Simulator is used to find a shortest path between two selected routers and 
    display the path between them. It will also display the connection table for a selected source router.

## The objective of this project is to perform flowing tasks:
-	To simulate the process of generating connection table for each router in each network.
-	To compute the optimal path with least cost between any two specific routers.

The network is defined in the "input.txt" file, where the matrix represents the distance from one router to another.

The application provides the following options to the user 
1. Create a Network Topology 
2. Build a Connection Table 
3. Shortest Path to Destination Router 
4. Modify a topology 
5. Best Router
6. Exit
